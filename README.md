# Camera Movement
Our program has a fully integrated system to move around the scene with keyboard and mouse input. To move around on the axis, the regular wasd and arrow keys may be used. 
To elevate the movement and rotate around the scene, press the left-mouse button __once__. To stop rotating around the scene, press the right-mouse button once.
Finally, the FOV may be adjusted by "zooming" with the mouse wheel.
The code for these mechanics may be found at the bottom of the "Camera" class.
